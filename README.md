# MSFAM

Multi-study factor analysis with missingness (MSFAM) performs factor analysis on multiple, incomplete data sets at once. 
Partitioning common and study-specific variance while accounting for the uncertainty of unobserved values yields accurate parameter estimates close to 
those estimated from complete data.

For multi-study factor analysis (MSFA) on complete data, see the 
[publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.12974) or [repository](https://github.com/rdevito/MSFA).

Run through example.Rmd to see how to utilize the MSFAM functions located in utils.R.
